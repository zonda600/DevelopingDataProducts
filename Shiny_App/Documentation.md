# Diamonds Dataset Tool Documentation

This tool utilizes the **diamonds** dataset that is included in base installations of RStudio, allowing easy use 
without loading additional data frames. The data compares carat size to quality of the cut.

The slider at the top left of the page will allow you to adjust the sample size and dynamically update the associated 
plots. You may also facet the graphs based on any of the fields available in the dataset. Selecting a facet will create 
one graph per the number of distinct values within that field.
